This subdirectory is for collecting and exploring potential components of a complete and integrated entity, including the business, legal and technical aspects.

Previous [proposed components lists](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-core-components-of-a-business) include:

List 1: 

* Administrative
* Production
* Customer Service
* Sales
* Marketing
* Human Resources

List 2: 

* Business Ownership
* Management
* Vision, Goals, Objects
* Product Mix
* Marketing strategy
* Staffing
* Accounting and payroll system
* Networking
* After sales service
* Innovation
* Control & Outsourcing & Evaluation

Both of the above lists, while good starts, have no clear place for "legal" and mix general activities (like innovation) with identified descrete and required functions (like HR or sales).
