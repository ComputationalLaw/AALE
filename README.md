# AALE: Automated and Autonomous Legal Entities

This site is an MIT Legal Engineering open, collaborative research project to identify, prototype a general design framework with "reference implementations" of automated and autonomous legal entities.

This research project include development of:

* Business [components and processes](https://github.com/ComputationalLaw/AALE/tree/master/Components) within the business
* Business boundary encapsulation between the business and the outside world
* Business interfaces connecting internal components and interaction between the business and the outside world
* Business data management including creation, collection, storage, access, measurement and analytics
* Business rules and governance including key roles, authorizations and control processes

This research is intended to produce a generic model, framework and high level specifications that can be used by others to help guide and extend their automated and autonomous business entity projects or products in efficient, effective and interiperable ways.
